## Homework Questions

### Question 1
- If we reverse the number 47 and add it with itself; 47 + 74 = 121, we get a palindromic number.It is not that easy to generate
a palindromic number from each number with this procedure,  namely by reversing and adding to itself. For some numbers, we repeat this process over and over to arrive at a palindromic number. For example, for the number 349, we need to repeat this process 3 times in a chain: (10 POINTS)

```Java
    349 + 943 = 1292       | 1292 + 2921 = 4213        | 4213 + 3124 = 7337
    (not palindrome number) (not palindrome number)     (palindrome number)
```
Accordingly, write a program that finds the longest chain for which number will form from the numbers from 10 to 100 until you get a palindromic number with this procedure and print the chain to the screen. (http://www.p196.org/)

### Question 9
- Create a class called MyList and write the code with the following properties. (15 POINTS)

  - It can only store String type variables.

  - It must contain add - print methods.

  - The Add method should only add string expressions that start with the letter 'C' to the list.

  - The print method should print the entire list to the screen.

  - Default capacity should be 5. Each capacity increase must be 7.

### Question 10
- Design an online shopping system that will contain a customer, product, order and invoice objects. (20 POINTS)

  - A customer can place more than one order.

  - There can be more than one product in an order.

  - The product has category, price, name and stock information.

  - Every order has an invoice.

- Illustrate the OOP concepts and Collection framework structures we learned in the lesson. Just like we did in the lessons, the necessary instance will be created via the Main method, no extra structure is needed. In this direction, write the code that answers the following questions.

  - Find the number of all customers in the system.
  - Calculate the number of products purchased by customers whose name is Cem.
  - Calculate the total shopping amount of customers whose name is Cem and who are younger than 30 and older than 25.
  - List all invoices over 1500 TL in the system.
